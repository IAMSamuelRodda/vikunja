# Fork Documentation Assets

This directory contains demo videos and screenshots for fork-specific features.

## Adding Demos

### Recording Workflow

1. **Install peek** (for direct GIF) or use any screen recorder:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install peek
   ```

2. **Record your demo** - Focus on the specific feature, keep it short (5-15 seconds)

3. **For higher quality, record MP4 and upload to GitHub**:
   - Drag MP4 into any GitHub issue/PR comment
   - Copy the generated `user-attachments` URL
   - Embed in FORK.md: `![Demo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...)`

### Naming Convention

| Feature | Filename |
|---------|----------|
| RRULE Sync | `rrule-sync-demo.mp4` |
| Compact Sidebar | `sidebar-compact-demo.mp4` |
